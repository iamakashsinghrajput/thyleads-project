## Lookalike Campaign: Clone Your Best Customers

Why it works: Companies similar to your top customers are 5x more likely to convert.

How to execute:

- Use Apify or Ocean.ai to scrape lookalike profiles.
- Filter by: Tech stack (BuiltWith, HG Insights) Revenue & employee count (ZoomInfo, Crunchbase) Google search operators for manual hunting: “Companies like [Top Customer]” + “CEO” OR “VP of [Relevant Dept]”

- Tech stack (BuiltWith, HG Insights)
- Revenue & employee count (ZoomInfo, Crunchbase)
- Google search operators for manual hunting:
- “Companies like [Top Customer]” + “CEO” OR “VP of [Relevant Dept]”

Pro Tip: Layer in firmographic + technographic matching for precision.

## Past Customer Campaign: Re-Engage Former Champions

Why it works: Past users already know your product’s value—they just need the right context.

How to execute:

- Use Clearbit or Salesforce to track where ex-customers work now.
- Message template: “Hey [Name], saw you’re now at [New Co]. We helped you drive [result] at [Old Co]—think we could replicate that here?”

Best for: Expansion plays and quick wins.

## Keyword-Based Campaign: Target Active Seekers

Why it works: Prospects publicly discussing pain points are low-hanging fruit.

Where to find intent signals:

- Job postings (e.g., “Looking for a CRM with [your feature]”)
- LinkedIn posts (“Struggling with [problem you solve]”)
- Forums (Reddit, G2, Slack communities)

Tool Stack:

- HireEZ (for job description scraping)
- Awario (social listening)

## News-Based Campaign: Strike When Iron’s Hot

Why it works: Companies in growth mode (funding, new hires, expansions) have budget.

Top Triggers:

- Funding rounds (Crunchbase, PitchBook)
- Product launches (Google Alerts, Mention)
- Leadership changes (People.ai)

Template:

*“Congrats on the $[X]M Series B! With [initiative from news], you might need [solution]. [Customer X] achieved [result] in similar shoes—worth a chat?”*

## Job Posting Campaign: Follow the Money

Why it works: Hiring for a role = budget allocated for that function.

Key Roles to Track:

- “Head of RevOps” → Sales tools
- “E-Commerce Manager” → RetailTech
- “Data Engineer” → Analytics platforms

Tool: Hiretual (scrapes job boards for real-time alerts).

## Job Change Campaign: Catch Decision-Makers Early

Why it works: New hires want to make an impact in their first 90 days.

How to execute:

- Track LinkedIn job changes (Phantombuster, Taplio).
- Outreach within 7 days of their start date.

Focus on their mandate (e.g., *“Heard you’re leading [initiative]—here’s how we helped [peer company].”*)

## Competitor Engagement Campaign: Steal Market Share

Why it works: Competitor users are already educated on the space.

How to find them:

- Trigify (tracks social engagement with competitors).
- G2/TrustRadius reviews (message unhappy users).
- Tech stack tools (BuiltWith, HG Insights).

Positioning: *“Not happy with [Competitor]’s [limitation]? We solved this for [Customer].”*

## Indirect Competitor Campaign: Ride Coattails

Why it works: Companies using adjacent tools likely need yours next.

Example:

- If they use Segment → Pitch your CDP.
- If they use Zapier → Pitch your native integration.

Tool: Clearbit (identifies installed software).

## Event Attendee Campaign: Warm Leads on Autopilot

Why it works: Event attendees are primed to engage.

How to execute:

- Scrape attendee lists (Koncert, Brevet).
- Send personalized video recaps (Veed.io).

Use event-specific hooks (e.g., *“Loved your question about [topic] at [Event]”*).

## Website Visitor Campaign: Instant Engagement

Why it works: Anonymous visitors = high intent but no follow-up.

How to execute:

- Leadfeeder/Factors (identifies visiting companies).
- Real-time LinkedIn ads (Matched Audiences).
- Chatbot sequences (Drift, Qualified).

Template:

*“Noticed you checked out [feature page]—any questions? We helped [similar company] achieve [result] with this.”*

### Key Takeaway

GTM success isn’t about volume—it’s about relevance. By focusing on high-intent signals and strategic triggers, you can 10x meeting bookings without spamming.
