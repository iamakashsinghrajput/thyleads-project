After running thousands of campaigns, here are the biggest lessons we’ve learned—the hard way—about cold email, LinkedIn automation, and deliverability in 2024.

- 1. Smartlead is the Undisputed King of Email Outreach
- 2. LinkedIn Automation is a Silent Growth Hack
- 3. Multiple Admin Accounts = Better Deliverability
- 4. Outlook Mailboxes Are a Black Hole
- 5. A Rushed Warmup = Guaranteed Disaster
- 6. Reusing Email IDs = Fast-Track to a Ban
- 7. Waterfall Enrichment is Non-Negotiable
- 8. “Cheesy Personalization” is Dead
- 9. These 5 Tools Are Outreach Game-Changers
- 10. Stop Obsessing Over Open Rates

## Smartlead is the Undisputed King of Email Outreach

We’ve tested every major cold email tool, and Smartlead consistently delivers:

✅ Best inbox placement (Gmail & Workspace)
✅ Unmatched automation flexibility (conditional steps, multi-channel sequencing)
✅ Built-in spam avoidance features (auto-pacing, domain rotation)

Verdict: If you’re serious about scaling outreach, this is the tool.

## LinkedIn Automation is a Silent Growth Hack

While everyone obsesses over email, LinkedIn automation is quietly crushing it for:

✔ Higher reply rates (less noise than email)
✔ Warmer lead gen (especially for enterprise sales)
✔ Multi-touch sequences (combine with email for 2X responses)

Tool Pick: [Octopus CRM](https://octopuscrm.io/) or [Dux-Soup](https://dux-soup.com/) for safe, human-like automation.

## Multiple Admin Accounts = Better Deliverability

Gmail and Workspace track payment fingerprints. If you’re setting up domains:

🔹 Use different credit cards for each admin account
🔹 Avoid same-name profiles (John Doe 1, John Doe 2 = 🚩)
🔹 Space out domain creation (no bulk setups)

Why? Reduces “bulk sender” flags from Google.

## Outlook Mailboxes Are a Black Hole

Microsoft’s spam filters are brutal. Even well-warmed emails land in junk.

➜ Prioritize: Gmail, Workspace, ProtonMail
➜ If you must email Outlook:

- Use engaged lists only (no cold prospects)
- Avoid links in first email

## A Rushed Warmup = Guaranteed Disaster

Three weeks is the bare minimum for a new domain.

✔ Daily sends: Start at 5-10/day, scale slowly
✔ Engagement matters: Replies > opens
✔ Always have backups: Rotate 2-3 domains

Pro Tip: Use [MailReach](https://mailreach.co/) for AI-powered warmup.

## Reusing Email IDs = Fast-Track to a Ban

Sending the same email in multiple campaigns? Big mistake.

➜ Minimum 15-minute gap between sends
➜ Better yet: Use unique aliases per campaign

Why? ESPs flag “burst sending” as spam.

## Waterfall Enrichment is Non-Negotiable

Never send to unverified emails. Use:

- Syntax check (e.g., Hunter’s free verifier)

- DNS/MX lookup (e.g., NeverBounce)

- Real-time ping (e.g., Dropcontact)

For phones: Triple-check via [NumLookup](https://www.numlookup.com/).

## “Cheesy Personalization” is Dead

❌ *“I saw you went to [University]…”***✅ *“Your post on [specific pain point] resonated—we helped [similar company] solve this by [result].”*

The shift: Problem-aware messaging > vanity personalization.

## These 5 Tools Are Outreach Game-Changers

| Tool | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- |
| Clay | Build hyper-personalized sequences at scale |
| Make/Pabbly | Automate lead enrichment & CRM updates |
| RB2B | B2B lead gen with verified data |
| Apify | Scrape & enrich data from LinkedIn/websites |

Missing these? You’re leaving replies on the table.

## Stop Obsessing Over Open Rates

Why? Opens/clicks are gamed metrics. Focus on:

✔ Reply rates (the only metric that matters)
✔ Spintax variations (avoid pattern detection)

Example:
*“{Hey|Hi} {First Name|Team},”* → 20%+ more inbox reach.

### Key Takeaway

Outreach in 2024 is about smarter tools, stricter compliance, and ruthless relevance. The companies winning aren’t just sending more emails—they’re sending emails that actually get replies.
