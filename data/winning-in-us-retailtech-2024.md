## Email Deliverability: The Silent Killer (and How to Fix It)

Most RetailTech buyers ignore or distrust emails from foreign IPs. If your outreach is failing, your infrastructure might be the problem.

✅ Do this:

- Use US-based SMTP servers (e.g., SocketLabs, Amazon SES)
- Pair with Smartlead or Instantly.ai for domain rotation
- Monitor spam scores with GlockApps or Mail-Tester

- Shared IPs (especially from India/Eastern Europe)
- Sending from generic domains (e.g., @gmail.com)

## Sales Navigator is Broken (Here’s How to Fix Your Targeting)

Most teams rely on basic filters like “Fashion & Apparel”—but 40%+ of relevant retailers are miscategorized under:

- “Internet” (DTC brands)
- “Manufacturing” (private-label sellers)
- “Wholesale” (B2B marketplaces)

- Use Google search operators to uncover hidden targets: site:linkedin.com/in “VP of E-Commerce” “previously at Nordstrom” “Shopify Plus” AND “hiring” AND “retail”
- Scrape niche directories like: Retail Dive’s Top 100 Retailers Digital Commerce 360’s database
- Enrich with Apollo or ZoomInfo to verify tech stacks

- site:linkedin.com/in “VP of E-Commerce” “previously at Nordstrom”
- “Shopify Plus” AND “hiring” AND “retail”

- Retail Dive’s Top 100 Retailers
- Digital Commerce 360’s database
