## Why Real-Time News Tracking is the Future of Sales Prospecting

## Curate High-Impact RSS Feeds for Your Industry

#### Why RSS Feeds?

RSS feeds act as your 24/7 news radar, delivering real-time updates from industry publications, company blogs, and news sites—without you having to manually scout for updates.

#### How to Choose the Right Feeds

##### Focus on three key types of sources:

- Industry News Hubs (e.g., Retail Dive for retail, Healthcare IT News for health tech)
- Competitor & Customer Blogs (Track announcements from companies you want to sell to.)
- Niche Publications (e.g., The Information for tech, Chain Store Age for retail expansions)

Pro Tip: Use tools like Feedly or Inoreader to aggregate multiple RSS feeds into a single dashboard before piping them into Clay.

## Integrate RSS Feeds into Clay for Automated Tracking

#### How Clay Supercharges Your Prospecting

Clay doesn’t just pull news—it structures, filters, and activates it for sales outreach.

#### Here’s how to set it up:

- Connect your RSS feeds (Clay supports direct integrations or Zapier if needed).
- Set up automatic ingestion so Clay continuously scans for new updates.
- Map incoming data to company profiles in your CRM or prospecting list.

If *TechCrunch* publishes *“Retailer X Raises $50M for Omnichannel Expansion,”* Clay will:
✔ Detect the article
✔ Extract the company name
✔ Match it to your CRM
✔ Flag it as a high-priority lead

## Laser-Focus Your Alerts with Smart Keyword Filters

##### Why Keywords Matter

Not every news update is worth acting on. You need to filter for signals that indicate buying intent.

##### Best Practices for Keyword Setup

- Track funding & hiring signals: “Secures $[X]M in funding” “Hires new VP of [Relevant Dept]”
- Product/expansion triggers: “Launches new eCommerce platform” “Expands into [market]”
- Pain point keywords: “Struggles with [problem you solve]” “Seeks [solution category]”

- “Secures $[X]M in funding”
- “Hires new VP of [Relevant Dept]”

- “Launches new eCommerce platform”
- “Expands into [market]”

- “Struggles with [problem you solve]”
- “Seeks [solution category]”

Pro Tip: Use Boolean search (e.g., *“retail” AND “cloud migration”*) to eliminate false positives.

## Auto-Tag & Score Leads Based on News Triggers

##### Turning News into Actionable Insights

Clay can auto-tag companies based on the type of news, so your sales team knows exactly how to prioritize them.

Example Tags:

- “🚀 Funding Round – High Priority”
- “🛒 Expanding E-Commerce – Mid Funnel”
- “🔧 Tech Stack Overhaul – Immediate Follow-Up”

Bonus: Sync these tags to your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce) to trigger automated workflows.

## Launch Scalable, Yet Highly Personalized Outreach

##### The Outreach Formula That Works

The key is referencing the news while tying it back to your solution—without sounding robotic.

Email/LinkedIn Template:

*“Hi [First Name],****Congrats on [specific news—e.g., ‘the $20M Series B’]! With [Company] focusing on [initiative from article], I thought you might find this helpful: [Brief case study/solution fit].*
*Would it make sense to explore how [Your Product] helped [Similar Company] achieve [Result]?*”

##### Advanced Tactics:

- Dynamic merge fields (Clay can auto-insert the latest news into templates).
- Multi-touch sequences (e.g., LinkedIn follow-up 3 days after email).

CEO/Executive Alerts (For major news, send a higher-touch handwritten note).
